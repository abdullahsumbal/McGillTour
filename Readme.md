## McGill Tour

#### Link to Web application: http://www.abdullahsumbal.com/mcgilltour

This is a personal project that I worked on using leaflet maps. The website can find the shortest path between two building on McGill University Campus. I am using Dijkstra Algorithm to find the shortest Path. Building (points) and paths (edges) are all defined in geojson format.
